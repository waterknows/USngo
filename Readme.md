##The United States Nonprofits Database

I am building a database of 1,574,146 nonprofit organizations in US. The purpose is two-fold: 1) guide individual donors to make more informed giving; 2) help researchers to understand the landscape of nonprofit sectors in US. The data mainly comes from [IRS](www.irs.gov), [Charity Navigator](www.charitynavigator.org) and [United States Census Bureau](www.census.gov).
